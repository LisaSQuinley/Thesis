### Abstract

Six years of drought has damaged both Morocco’s agricultural output as well as its economy. The worsening drought and extreme weather events in Morocco are clearly due to climate change which is caused by increasing greenhouse gases. Morocco is used as an example of the kinds of challenges that a country and its people can face due to global warming. It is also clear that the coming decades will become even more difficult for societies to manage. Morocco has already adopted a variety of coping strategies, but there is more that needs to be done at the individual, community, and national levels to mitigate both the current situation and for the future. This thesis illustrates the story of the situation in Morocco as well as the kinds of actions needed. While the types of problems that arise varies greatly between countries, the story of Morocco is an example of the need for adaptation and mitigation that all countries around the world will need to face. I am particularly interested in Morocco due to the conditional acceptance I received to be a Climate-Smart Youth Development Facilitator as a Peace Corps Volunteer starting later this year. My role would include fostering climate-aware youth leaders.
 
### Acknowledgments

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Daniel Sauter, whose insight, encouragement, and unwavering support were instrumental throughout this process. His ability to challenge my thinking, provide clarity and encouragement when I felt overwhelmed, and connect me with valuable resources was essential in shaping both my thesis and my growth as a data visualization designer and storyteller.

I am deeply grateful to Bernadette Ludwig, who guided me during my Global Studies undergraduate program at Eugene Lang and supported my passion for combining global studies, graphic design, and children’s education. Her encouragement to expand my Parsons Senior Thesis on gender equality in children’s books and her thoughtful recommendation were pivotal to my academic path. Her belief in interdisciplinary thinking continues to inspire my work.
I would also like to thank Laurie Berger and Debbie Lofaso, my mentors at Benchmark Education Co., whose steadfast support of my dreams for higher education and career growth in design has meant so much to me. Their guidance, encouragement, and confidence in my abilities not only strengthened my resolve to pursue this degree but also shaped the way I approach creativity and learning in meaningful, lasting ways.

I am also profoundly grateful to the Data Visualization cohort of 2024–2025. Being part of this driven and compassionate group made the demands of an intense, one-year, full-time program not only manageable but enriching. Their daily collaboration, honest feedback, and quiet but powerful emotional support—especially during challenging personal times—meant more than words can express.
I would also like to acknowledge the assistance of ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. Its support was invaluable in helping me troubleshoot coding issues that I could not resolve through other resources, understand the nuances of Chicago-style formatting, and navigate complex features in Microsoft Word more efficiently.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, Suomi Sakai and John Quinley, for their unwavering belief in me. Their love and encouragement have been the foundation of all my pursuits, and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to follow my passion.

### Introduction
News reports have been filled in recent years with examples of extreme weather events. The Los Angelos wildfires in early January caused by dry conditions led to the loss of lives and the destruction of thousands of homes and businesses. Hurricane Helene flooded parts of the southeast United States leading to at least 219 deaths and an economic impact of $78 billion. An extreme heatwave in Saudi Arabia during the Haj pilgrimage season saw temperatures of at least 43C (109F) every day from 1-22 June and 1,301 deaths, mostly attributed to the heat. A prolonged drought in southern Africa led to a total grain production drop of 50% in Zambia. Typhoon Yagi struck China, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar with over 700 deaths reported and extensive flooding and wind damage. Climate scientists are realizing that these extreme weather events are a natural consequence of the overall global warming due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases. 

Morocco is in its sixth year of a drought that is damaging its agricultural sector and overall economy. In addition to the drought, Morocco has had extreme heat waves and local torrential rains with flooding. The country has a Mediterranean climate in the north and becomes increasingly arid in the south. Weather in Morocco has always been highly variable with good years and bad years depending on precipitation.  However, this multi-year drought appears to be tightly linked with and is predicted by the effects of global warming. The most vulnerable groups are the roughly one third of the population living in rural areas who are small-scale farmers and herdsmen, as well as traditional oasis-dwellers and nomads.  Morocco has been engaged in a variety of coping mechanisms for the drought, including dams to store water, using well water, traditional water management systems like khettaras, and desalination. On the water use side, Morocco has been promoting drip irrigation, re-use of treated wastewater, and restriction of water use in urban areas to conserve water resources. Unfortunately, climate models predict that depending on continued greenhouse gas emissions, the situation will continue to worsen over the coming decades.  Within the country, youth need to understand the situation and what can be done at the individual, community, and national level. However, the drivers of climate change are not controlled by any one country and people need to understand the global sources and the role of all countries in preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

The purpose of this project is to create visuals–such as infographics and diagrams–that can be used to illustrate the situation and coping mechanisms for Morocco. These products, or pages, are designed to appeal to an American audience, however, if I end up volunteering in Morocco, I will need to revisit and redesign them with people who understand the local culture. And though redesigning these graphics to be culturally and aesthetically appropriate for a Moroccan public is important, the project is first and foremost aimed toward a youth audience. My project aims to provide a bridge between complex statistical and analytical data on the country’s climate situation and young people who are our proponents for solutions and steps toward reducing the consequences of global warming. I provide visuals that can be used as tools individually or together to teach and illustrate what has happened, what is happening, and what could happen because of climate change in Morocco.

For human-related climate change, there are a wide variety of analyses already available from international organizations. There are several sources regarding fossil fuel use, atmospheric greenhouse gases, and climate change. Based on the literature review, these include UN agencies, US government agencies and academic and NGO data repositories. An example of a relevant data file I have found is from the Climate Change Dashboard of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Groups such as the World Weather Attribution attempt to determine whether specific extreme weather events are likely to have been caused by or are related to climate change. Information about the impact on Morocco and coping mechanisms are found in organizations such as the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the United States Department of Agriculture. Specific actions are often reported in local and international newspapers.

### Morocco: A Country in Context

Morocco’s six years of drought has greatly reduced agricultural output and affected its economy.  The situation has become dire enough that “King Mohammed VI has urged his fellow Moroccans not to slaughter sheep for [the] upcoming Eid al-Adha festivities in June 2025 as the country grapples with dwindling herds.”  Morocco is a majority Muslim country and Eid al-Adha is a major holiday where Muslim families slaughter a sheep or goat and share it with their neighbors. Being able to engage in this celebration is an important part of their culture. Morocco has lost 38% of its cattle and sheep populations since the last census in 2016 due to drought.  The shortage of livestock has intensified inflation in the country. The NGO, Moroccan Center for Citizenship, surveyed families last year and 55% “…said they struggled to cover the costs of buying sheep and the utensils needed to prepare them…” This “tradition [is] so embedded that families have been known to take out loans to buy [a] sheep.” 

It is not just livestock that is affected by the drought. Morocco’s two largest cereal crops are wheat and barley. The severe drought of 2024 led to a drop in production of 40-50% for both crops compared to the previous five years.  Wheat is primarily used to make bread, Morocco’s staple food, and the government has had to import millions of tons of wheat to make up the difference caused by this deficit.  Irrigated crops represent only 16% of the total cultivated land but account for 75% of the value of Morocco’s agricultural exports.  But due to low water levels in dams across the country, the amount of land that can be irrigated has contracted.  

Morocco has been impacted by other extreme weather events over the years. A heat wave in April of 2024 resulted in the deaths of at least 21 people in the central city of Beni Mellal according to the Moroccan Health Ministry. Temperatures reached up to 48°C (118°F).  In late September of 2024, torrential rains triggered flooding in southern parts of Morocco, killing at least 28 people. The area where the flooding occurred is not within Morocco’s main agricultural areas, so it did not break the drought.  
Morocco is a country of contrasts. Central north, with the capital, Rabat, and the largest city, Casablanca, are along the Atlantic Coast and are in a hot summer Mediterranean climate area, as is most of southern Spain and Portugal. This area typically receives rainfall in the winter and is dry in the summer.  It is the location of a majority of Morocco’s irrigated farms and rain-fed cereal crops.  The Atlas Mountains cross the middle of the country and are so high that there are ski resorts with a height as high as 3,200m (10,000ft).  This mountainous region has a cold, semi-arid climate with hot, semi-arid areas at the base where oases are found. Both areas contribute to Morocco’s pastureland. The mountains are mainly inhabited by the indigenous Berber peoples who make up almost a third of the Moroccan population.  On the south side of the mountains lies the Sahara Desert with a hot, desert climate. 

About one third of the country’s population is rural and most are small-holder farmers or herdsmen. These groups are the most vulnerable to drought, along with oases-dwellers and Morocco’s small population of nomads.
