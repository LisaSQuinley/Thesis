###### Abstract
The whole world is struggling to adapt to climate change in varying degrees. Tremendous accommodations are required and not everyone is equally equipped. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, particularly in developing countries, where resources and coping mechanisms are limited. Some of the worst impacts are or will be on the people who have the least ability to manage. This study focuses on societies that engage in subsistence farming as a prime example. Women in these societies are primarily responsible for growing the crops as well as childcare. They have little ability to employ adaptive strategies when severe weather disrupts their food production. 

Data from climate researchers, the United Nations, and other reputable sources will be examined. Evidence will be presented that it has become increasingly apparent that global warming is associated in many parts of the world with extreme and highly variable weather such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. This is expected to worsen in the coming years. Further evidence will be explored on the impact this trend will have on agriculture. Specific focus is on agriculture on small farms in the Global South. It will be shown that these families and societies have contributed the least to the problem of global warming and have the most difficulties in trying to cope with this situation. 

Not only has the Global North, which is the primary producer of climate change, not taken adequate action to rapidly reduce emissions, but their assistance to the poorest to help mitigate the consequences of said climate change has fallen short. Both of these are further threatened by today’s political climate. 

This is a rapidly evolving area of study, I hope to bring together disparate sources of data, to clarify these links.
