###### Introduction (work in progress)
With the start of the Trump administration on January 21st, 2025, the United States government has been taking measures to promote fossil fuels, renege on climate agreements, discourage renewable energy, and cancel foreign aid, all while claiming that climate change is a hoax, that foreign aid is a waste of money, and that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is “a criminal organization”. I know many people who have worked or are working in foreign aid and for the environment, so my interest is intensely personal. This project is meant to present the evidence that clearly shows climate change is real, it is caused by greenhouse gas emissions primarily from wealthy countries and in addition to global warming, it is clearly linked to extreme weather events. And while these events impact all countries, they disproportionately affect vulnerable groups in the Global South. There exist policies that can more rapidly reduce emissions and interventions that can help mitigate their worst effects among the poor.

The scientific basis of understanding earth’s climate developed gradually in the 1800s. For example, John Tyndall and Svante Arrhenius made key contributions to understanding how gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat. This laid the foundation for the theory of the greenhouse effect. At the same time, industrialization led to the development of fossil fuels as the primary energy source. After World War II there was a global economic boom which increased the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. In 1958, C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institute began measuring CO2 levels in the atmosphere on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. These measurements have continued under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and show a steady increase in CO2 every year. They were the first direct evidence that greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere were increasing.

In 1988, James Hansen, a NASA scientist, testified to the US Senate that (1) “[t]he Earth is warmer than at any other time in recent history,” (2) “[t]his global warming can be attributed, with 99% certainty, to a man-made increase in the greenhouse effect, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels and changes in the way we use land,” and (3) “[t]his greenhouse effect is making extreme weather events like heat waves, storms, and droughts more frequent and intense.” Although controversial in its time, his statements were pivotal in raising global awareness of the climate crisis and have been proven over and over again by subsequent events. Following this came a number of international agreements to help curb greenhouse gas emissions. These include the 1992 Rio Earth Summit during which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and more recently the 2015 Paris Accords which the Trump administration has now abandoned twice.

Paragraph on foreign aid - to come.

There are a number of sources regarding fossil fuel use, atmospheric greenhouse gases, and climate change. As you can see in the notes below (to be cleaned up and added to later, currently just some of the historical references), these include UN agencies, US government agencies, as well as books and newspaper articles. An example of a relevant data file I have found is from the Climate Change Dashboard of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which provides counts of different kinds of extreme weather events by country and by year from 1980 to 2022. I am hopeful to find datasets on fossil fuels, greenhouse gases, and global warming which should be readily available from climate dashboards of this sort. They are also available in Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org) which not only presents but also references original data sources. So far there are many reports of the impact of extreme weather in the Global South, however large datasets are more difficult to come by since these review articles mostly seem to discuss large numbers of specific examples. How I will use this data in my project I am still working on.

###### Abstract
The whole world is struggling to adapt to climate change in varying degrees. Tremendous accommodations are required and not everyone is equally equipped. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, particularly in developing countries, where resources and coping mechanisms are limited. Some of the worst impacts are or will be on the people who have the least ability to manage. This study focuses on societies that engage in subsistence farming as a prime example. Women in these societies are primarily responsible for growing the crops as well as childcare. They have little ability to employ adaptive strategies when severe weather disrupts their food production. 

Data from climate researchers, the United Nations, and other reputable sources will be examined. Evidence will be presented that it has become increasingly apparent that global warming is associated in many parts of the world with extreme and highly variable weather such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. This is expected to worsen in the coming years. Further evidence will be explored on the impact this trend will have on agriculture. Specific focus is on agriculture on small farms in the Global South. It will be shown that these families and societies have contributed the least to the problem of global warming and have the most difficulties in trying to cope with this situation. 

Not only has the Global North, which is the primary producer of climate change, not taken adequate action to rapidly reduce emissions, but their assistance to the poorest to help mitigate the consequences of said climate change has fallen short. Both of these are further threatened by today’s political climate. 

This is a rapidly evolving area of study, I hope to bring together disparate sources of data, to clarify these links.
