Title to come - (World Overview).
What patterns are there globally regarding the occurrence of disasters? What trends can we see as we review these incidents over time?
EM-DAT dataset "on the occurrence and impacts of over 26,000 mass disasters worldwide from 1900 to the present day."
There are about 10300 data points in this dataset and the "database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, reinsurance companies, research institutes, and press agencies." (https://www.emdat.be/)
World map with color coding and possibly iconography.

Title to come - (African Continent)
What patterns are there amongst the countries in the African continent with regards to incomes and their levels of vulnerability and lack of coping capacity? 
INFORM Risk Index dataset. "INFORM is a multi-stakeholder forum for developing shared, quantitative analysis relevant to humanitarian crises and disasters. INFORM includes organisations from across the multilateral system, including the humanitarian and development sector, donors, and technical partners. The Joint Research Center of European Commission is the scientific lead for INFORM." (https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index)
There are scores for 190 countries in a number of categories, the ones I will be visualizing will be Vulnerability, Lack of Coping Capacity, and the Inform Risk Index.
Continent map with color coding, possibly a bar chart.

Title to come - (Morocco)
How does Morocco differ from other countries with regards to disasters?
Both the EM-DAT dataset and the INFORM Risk Index dataset.
The focus will be on all disaster occurrences over time and all categories regarding the Inform Risk Index for Morocco.
Country map, timeline, other possibilities not yet decided or sketched.


#### 1. Introduction (revised)
##### 1.1. My Goal
This Thesis is designed around how to introduce the ideas of climate change, the hazards of extreme weather events first globally, but then focused on Morocco as a specific case. My goal is to inform and educate audiences, especially youth, in Morocco about the global situation regarding fossil fuel emissions, climate change, and its related extreme weather events. Morocco has been experiencing a climate-change-associated drought and extreme heat waves in the past few years which has significantly affected the economy. I would review actions that countries, including Morocco, can take to mitigate the existing and potential impact of climate change in the future. My hope is that this approach could be expanded and used for any country especially since our youth are the ones that need to become informed, participating citizens, and will be our future leaders.
##### 1.2. A Little Bit of Background (As To Why I Care)
###### 1.2.a.The Political Climate
With the start of the Trump administration on January 21st, 2025, the United States government has been taking measures to promote fossil fuels, renege on climate agreements, discourage renewable energy, and cancel foreign aid, all while claiming that climate change is a hoax, that foreign aid is a waste of money, and that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is “a criminal organization”. I know many people who have worked or are working in foreign aid and for the environment, so my interest is intensely personal. This project is meant to present the evidence that clearly shows climate change is real, it is caused by greenhouse gas emissions primarily from wealthy countries and in addition to global warming, it is clearly linked to extreme weather events. And while these events impact all countries, they disproportionately affect lower and middle income countries (LMIC) who have less capacity to adapt. Instead of taking a leadership role in dealing with climate change, the current administration is choosing to ignore and deny the problem.
###### 1.2.b. The Science and History of Climate Change
The scientific basis of understanding earth’s climate developed gradually in the 1800s. For example, John Tyndall and Svante Arrhenius made key contributions to understanding how gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat. This laid the foundation for the theory of the greenhouse effect. At the same time, industrialization led to the development of fossil fuels as the primary energy source. After World War II there was a global economic boom which increased the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. In 1958, C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institute began measuring CO2 levels in the atmosphere on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. These measurements have continued under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and show a steady increase in CO2 every year. They were the first direct evidence that greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere were increasing.

In 1988, James Hansen, a NASA scientist, testified to the US Senate that (1) “[t]he Earth is warmer than at any other time in recent history,” (2) “[t]his global warming can be attributed, with 99% certainty, to a man-made increase in the greenhouse effect, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels and changes in the way we use land,” and (3) “[t]his greenhouse effect is making extreme weather events like heat waves, storms, and droughts more frequent and intense.” Although controversial in its time, his statements were pivotal in raising global awareness of the climate crisis and have been proven over and over again by subsequent events. Following this came a number of international agreements to help curb greenhouse gas emissions. These include the 1992 Rio Earth Summit during which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and more recently the 2015 Paris Accords which the Trump administration has now abandoned twice.
##### 1.3. Morocco, Where Does It Fit?
While we hope the United States might change their approach, citizens of any country can take the initiative to inform themselves about the issues and support measures to control climate change and mitigate its effects. Morocco is the study country which I investigate in this project because it is a middle income country that has the capacity to take measures. I am hopeful that materials for the Thesis could actually be used. It could contribute to discussions in Morocco about climate change and further aid in youth education.
###### 1.4. Data for the Viz
There are a number of sources regarding fossil fuel use, atmospheric greenhouse gases, and climate change. Based on the literature review, these include UN agencies, US government agencies, as well as books and newspaper articles and academic and NGO data repositories. An example of a relevant data file I have found is from the Climate Change Dashboard of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which provides counts of different kinds of extreme weather events by country and by year from 1980 to 2022. This was derived from EM-DAT, or the Emergency Events Database–a database that records the occurrence and impact of disasters worldwide. It is used to help with decision-making for disaster preparedness and humanitarian action. I am hopeful to find additional datasets on fossil fuels, greenhouse gases, and global warming which should be readily available from climate dashboards of this sort. They are also available in Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org) which not only presents but also references original data sources. So far there are many reports of the impact of extreme weather in the Global South, however large datasets are more difficult to come by since these review articles mostly seem to discuss large numbers of specific examples. I will survey extreme weather events globally but then focus on specific events in Morocco.
###### 1.5. The Main Ideas
Who? Youth and general public.
What? Climate change, expected impacts, ways forward.
Where? Morocco.
When? Looking at the past, understanding the present, anticipating the future.

How? Data visualization, data storytelling aka MY THESIS.


#### Abstract (to be revised)
The whole world is struggling to adapt to climate change in varying degrees. Tremendous accommodations are required and not everyone is equally equipped. Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, particularly in developing countries, where resources and coping mechanisms are limited. Some of the worst impacts are or will be on the people who have the least ability to manage. This study focuses on societies that engage in subsistence farming as a prime example. Women in these societies are primarily responsible for growing the crops as well as childcare. They have little ability to employ adaptive strategies when severe weather disrupts their food production. 

Data from climate researchers, the United Nations, and other reputable sources will be examined. Evidence will be presented that it has become increasingly apparent that global warming is associated in many parts of the world with extreme and highly variable weather such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. This is expected to worsen in the coming years. Further evidence will be explored on the impact this trend will have on agriculture. Specific focus is on agriculture on small farms in the Global South. It will be shown that these families and societies have contributed the least to the problem of global warming and have the most difficulties in trying to cope with this situation. 

Not only has the Global North, which is the primary producer of climate change, not taken adequate action to rapidly reduce emissions, but their assistance to the poorest to help mitigate the consequences of said climate change has fallen short. Both of these are further threatened by today’s political climate. 

This is a rapidly evolving area of study, I hope to bring together disparate sources of data, to clarify these links.
